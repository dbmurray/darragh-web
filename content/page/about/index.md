Hello there! Thanks for stopping by my little corner of the web. I'm Darragh Murray, an experienced data professional based in Australia.

I've been working with data in some way, shape or form for over fifteen years. Starting my career in the information systems field, I've spent the last decade working in business intelligence and strategic analytics. 

Nowadays, I work as a data expert at the leading global real estate firm, Jones Lang LaSalle. Before that, I worked for nearly a decade data expert in the international education sector. I’ve also been involved in the music industry, being a freelance music journalist as well as a radio producer for local community radio. [I’ve recently been elected as a Tableau Social Ambassador for 2021](https://www.tableau.com/community/community-leaders/ambassadors). If you're interested in my career, [my LinkedIn profile has all the relevant details](https://www.linkedin.com/in/darraghmurray/).

This website functions as a space for my writing about analytics, data visualisation and occasionally other topics that manage to grab my interest. You'll also find content related to my growing portfolio of data visualisation work, as well as various tutorials and 'how to' guides. 

I generally concentrate on subjects such as:

* Use of data as a strategic tool for generating business insight.
* Specific posts on my data tools of interest - typically Tableau, R and Alteryx.
* Issues in international politics and economics that overlap with the digital humanities.
* Data storytelling as a useful method of exchanging knowledge – mainly using open data.
* Older posts relate to my past life working in the international education sector as well as my time as a database developer.

I regularly talk and write about the data and analytics and frequently present throughout the world on these topics. I’ve listed my conference appearances below.

I have formal tertiary qualifications in information systems, international relations, history and business analytics. 

Feel free to get in contact if you have any queries related to my professional work or feel like saying g’day.

Cheers!

Darragh
